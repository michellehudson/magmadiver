Things I think of.

[Zed's book](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html) is funny:
* A programmer will eventually tell you to use Mac OSX or Linux. If the programmer likes fonts and typography, they'll tell you to get a Mac OSX computer. If they like control and have a huge beard, they'll tell you to install Linux.

* Octothorpe is hilarious. 
* This is a thing I need to remember: What is the difference between = (single-equal) and == (double-equal)? The = (single-equal) assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left. The == (double-equal) tests if two things have the same value.

Things I think of.
---------------------

**2/10/2013:**
[Zed's book](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html) is funny:
* A programmer will eventually tell you to use Mac OSX or Linux. If the programmer likes fonts and typography, they'll tell you to get a Mac OSX computer. If they like control and have a huge beard, they'll tell you to install Linux.

**2/17/2013:**
* Octothorpe is hilarious. 
* This is a thing I need to remember: What is the difference between = (single-equal) and == (double-equal)? The = (single-equal) assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left. The == (double-equal) tests if two things have the same value.
* In exercise 5 I learned about format characters. An overview is here: [Python docs] (http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html)  

**2/20/2013:**
* Python Wet Lab! I have an Americano. Blue State is playing all kinds of crazy music. 
* Use %r when you want to display the raw data. 
* Use %s for strings, and %d for numbers. These are format types to display variables to users.
* Also, this on Exercise 7: Couldn't you just not use the comma, and turn the last two lines into one single-line print? Yes, you could very easily, but then it'd be longer than 80 characters which in Python is bad style.

**3/27/2013:**
* Finally back after a month of not pythoning. Here's to remembering what I'm doing!
* Important thing: escape sequences in Exercise 10. 

**5/1/2013:**
* Happy May Day! Back to work.
* Exercise 13 includes important things about adding "features" to scripts. These are modules. I was just trying to work with a program from the UW Data Science course that includes modules, so this is good timing.

**5/15/2013:**
* Back from Canada! So, here's what I messed up:
* In exercise 14, how do I know that I need to add my name while I'm running the script initially? I did it wrong the first time and of course got the "Need more than 1 value to unpack" for the argv module. So I have to run "python ex14.py Michelle" because it won't prompt me for my name -- it just wants to use it. That's okay and I understand now, but it isn't practical for an actual game. I'd want to prompt the user for his or her name.
* The "further study" for exercise 14 is playing Zork and Adventure. YES.
* For exercise 15, I had to remember how to open Pydoc. That's in exercise 12. On windows: python -m pydoc COMMAND.

**1/15/2014:**
* Oh hi!
* \n is a regular expression for new line. It factors into exercise 16.
* Trying to use strings, formats, and escapes to to the target.write more succintly. [This thread is interesting.] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6394170/very-basic-python-question-strings-formats-and-escapes)

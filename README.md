MAGMADIVER

Magmadiver is the name of an episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion. I think it's cool. It was the first thing I thought of when creating my repo for the project.

Michelle learns python. Watch as she does so using Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org).

Here is what Michelle has done:
* Markdown refresher (Look, I'm doing it!)
* Terminal refresher (I think I remember how to type, now.)
* Exercise 0 (Installed Python 2.7.3, set the path, good to go.)
* Exercises 1 - 4!

What Michelle has left to do:
* Every other exercise in the book
